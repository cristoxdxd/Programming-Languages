# Serialization

When we need to persist structs and enum instances, we need to think about serialization.

_Serialization_ is the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmittedand reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).

_Deserialization_ is the opposite process of serialization, converting data that has been stored in a file or other storage medium back into a data structure that can be manipulated in your code.
