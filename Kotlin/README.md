# What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.

## Why Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern programming language that compiles to Java bytecode. It is free and open source, and promises to make coding for Android even more fun.  

## What is the difference between Java and Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for the JVM, Android and the browser which is now officially supported by Google For Android. It's developed by JetBrains, the makers of IntelliJ on which Android Studio is based. It's a language that is expressive, concise, and powerful. Best of all, it's interoperable with our existing Android languages and runtime.

## Kotlin Compiler

Kotlin compiler produces byte-code, thus there really is no difference in terms of look and feel of Kotlin applications versus those written in Java.
