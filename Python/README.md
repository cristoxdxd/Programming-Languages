## Python Interpreter

Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is not compiled into machine code before execution. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.

## Python Versions

There are two versions of Python: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 is no longer supported, so it is recommended to use Python 3.

## Installing Python

To install Python, go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python 3.

## Running Python Code

To run Python code, you can use the Python interpreter. To open the Python interpreter, open the command line and type `python`. You can also run a Python script by typing `python <filename>`.
