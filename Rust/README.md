# What is Rust?

Rust is an open-source, systems programming language that you can use to develop efficient, safe software. With Rust, you can manage memory and control other low-level details. But you can also take advantage of high-level concepts like iteration and interfaces. These features set Rust apart from low-level languages like C and C++.  

**Advantages:**

- Type safe
- Memory safe
- Data race free
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Minimal runtime
- Targets bare metal

## Rust Module System

- _**Crates:**_ Smallest code unit that can be compiled into a binary executable or a library.

- _**Modules:**_ Used to organize code items and manage their scope.

- _**Paths:**_ Used to name items in code, and module feature controls privacy and hides implementation details.

## Rust Compiler

Compile rust programs using the command: `rustc main.rs`  
Then run Rust programs with `.\main.exe` command.

## Create and manage projects with Cargo

- Create new project templates with the `cargo new` command.
- Build a project with the `cargo build` command.
- Build and run a project with the `cargo run` command.
- Test a project with the `cargo test` command.
- Check project types with the `cargo check` command.
- Build documentation for a project with the `cargo doc` command.
- Publish a library to crates.io with the `cargo publish` command.
- Add dependent crates to a project by adding the crate name to the Cargo.toml file.
